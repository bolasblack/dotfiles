;;{{{  TODO
;; Make overlays window-specific. This will allow differently folded
;; views of a file.

;; fold-hide on an already closed nested fold should close the
;; surrounding fold (like folding.el does)

;; Fix all bugs:)
;;}}}
;;{{{  BUGS

;; It is way too easy to get text and overlays out of sync, because
;; many operations, especially undo, don't operate sensibly on
;; overlays. Maybe Fold mode could use text attributes, but I don't
;; want to go there right now.

;; fold-whole-buffer re-scans fold marks, which is slow. We have so
;; many ways for getting things out of whack that it seems necessary
;; to have a re-scan user command, but it should be a separate
;; command, and it should try to preserve invisibilty state.

;; kill-and-yank of folds loses fold overlays

;; kill-and-undo of folds loses fold overlays

;; There's a bug in undo that can shift overlay boundaries

;; Undo of fold-region leaves overlays in the buffer.  Many kinds of
;; kill or edit can leave us with orpaned or unusable overlays.

;; kill-line (C-k) in the title of a hidden fold will kill the hidden
;; part. This is not really a bug, but a result of the way Emacs
;; treats the hidden text in kill-line, which btw is inconsistent with
;; the behavior of end-of-line.

;;{{{ ---FIXED--- Some recently fixed bugs

;; close-fold doesn't work on last line of fold (usually the
;; terminating mark.) The reason is the move to end-of-line in
;; close-fold, which is there to move point inside folds that start
;; late on the line.

  "Set the fold marks for the current buffer.

Set the fold mark PREFIX, SUFFIX, and optionally the TOP, BOTTOM, and
SPECIAL mark.  Let '.' mean concatenation, then your folds will look
like this:

PREFIX.TOP.title.SUFFIX
  fold-contents
PREFIX.BOTTOM.SUFFIX

Magic markers look like PREFIX.TOP.nonwhite.BOTTOM.SUFFIX, where
nonwhite matches the [^ \t\n]* regexp. Something that looks like a
magic marker can never be a fold mark.

SPECIAL is not used anywhere.

Default values for, PREFIX, SUFFIX, TOP, BOTTOM, and SPECIAL are \"\",
\"\", \"{{{\", \"}}}\" and \":::\", respectively.

Using other than the default values for TOP and BOTTOM is not
recommended unless *really* necessary. For certain choices of TOP and
